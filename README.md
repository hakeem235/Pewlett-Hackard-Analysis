# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Analysis Overview

TThe purpose of this analysis is to create two tables:
One is to determine the number of employees retiring and their positions, and the other is to identify employees who are eligible to participate in mentoring programs. The first table contains information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end dates. In the second, I added the employee number, first and last name, date of birth, start and end dates, and position title.

## Results

The first table that determines the number of retiring employees and their position titles can be viewed here: [retiring_titles.csv]('')

The second table that identifies employee who are eligible for the mentorship program can be viewed here: [mentorship_eligibility.csv]('')

From these tables, we can see that there are four key takeaways: 
- Almost a third of the retirees are Senior Engineers, while another third includes the rest of the Senior Staff.
 - As a result, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions have the greatest priority when it comes to deciding which roles the company would like to fill
 - Among those that are retiring, there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program. 
 - There are more people retiring than there are potential mentors, which means that the company would have to create an efficient program that can cover the disparity between the number of people retiring and the number of people who can be trained to fill these positions.

 ## Summary

 - You can create a chart that divides retirees into age groups to determine how many people will need to take on the role.
- Each year the company (internal or external) can enter the number of people retiring if the retirement age is her 65.
- In the future, you can create a query that provides a list of people retiring at the end of this year (and each year thereafter).
From there, the company can prioritize how many younger employees need to be trained to fill retired positions.
- A company can use this chart to plan a mentoring program.
